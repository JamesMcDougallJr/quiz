This README is intended for the quiz javascript app I am developing via the
book "jsninja". It is my first javascript application. Hopefully after I
complete this simple app I will be prepared to continue developing javascript
applications. In the future I'm interested in Twilio API, using JSON files to
get drone data, and other computer engineering applications that come my way.
