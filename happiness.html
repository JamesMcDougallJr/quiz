<h1> How to be Happy. No, Actually! </h1>

<p>
Growing up, I had the best life ever – two parents that loved me, enough food to be full all the time, tons of toys, and a baby brother. I had all the things that should make a boy happy. But as I got older, I reached a point where I wasn’t happy. Even then, there was no shortage of food, no shortage of loving relationships, and no shortage of fun things to do. Yet, despite all this, in the cold dark hours of the night, my mind would roil with despondence to the point that I couldn’t sleep. Have you ever been there? You’re not alone. So what’s keeping us all up at night? Let’s take a look at my three main findings about happiness.

<ul>
  <li> 1.	Its okay to be sad.  If you feel sad about being sad, then you’ll just be more sad. So stop it.</li>
  <li> 2. Happiness is made up of a bunch of little things. I’ll go into this deeper later.</li>
  <li> 3. Existential happiness is different. It’s what drives us to strive for those little bits of happiness. </li>
</ul>
